CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Architecture **

•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

In the frontend development of the project, many applications, such as Express HTML, JavaScript, and SPA. Using Express HTML enabled users to create a foundation to build the website, including text, images, and other templates. The Express HTML retrieves the static HTML page to generate a well-structured page. JavaScript helps with front and backend coding dynamic elements such as functionality, validation, and user interactions. Lastly, with SPA, its main focus is improving user experience by modifying the interactive web application. Similarities include SPA and JavaScript, which focus on the frontend application. At the same time, Express HTML is used for the server side.

•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB enables easy integration for redesigning the database structure. Also, using MongoDB’s architecture is manageable for handling large volumes of data or horizontal scaling to distribute data throughout the servers to help improve performance over time.

**Functionality**

•	How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is a text-based data format that enables users and machines to store and transport data. JSON can be used to read and display data from web servers on a website. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language used to develop dynamic content for websites. JSON is different from JavaScript because its sole purpose is to format data. JSON can tie geotherm to the front and backend development using APIs to receive requests and send responses.  

•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

An instance in the entire stack process when refractured code was used to improve functionality, is replacing static HTML pages with handlebar templates. Replacing the templates enabled the change in content display. It made modifying changes without deployment and code changes to a website more accessible. The benefits of reusable UI components include reduced development time and promoting scalability. Reducing development time by reusing UI components helps stop rewriting JavaScript for each instance, improves consistency throughout the system, and makes maintenance easier.

**Testing**

•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Testing is an essential part of the project that helps safeguard applications from bugs, errors, and other issues. Methods are used to request and retrieve in the system using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST API is the foundation of communication for clients and servers to interact over HTTP. Endpoints combine the base URL of the API with a path to specify the resource and other identifiers. Testing endpoints can validate the functionality and ensure that error handling works correctly.  Adding additional layers of security can add complexity to the testing process to ensure sensitive data is not leaked.

**Reflection**

•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

Being in this course has helped me reach my professional goals by providing a better understanding of full-stack development and introducing new tools and frameworks. I have improved with frontend and backend development, which enables me to be a more competent developer who can demonstrate my skills to tackle complex projects. This course has also inspired me to become more innovative, working with Node.JS, MongoDB, and Express to build other projects.
